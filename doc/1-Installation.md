# Installation
:information_source: This page explains how to install a new server. If you need to connect to an existing server, you can directly go to the [Connect Guide](2-Connect.md).


## Usage using Docker
Clone this repository and run:
```
cd docker
docker-compose up
```
Then in a web browser, open `http://localhost`

Add `-d` argument (detach) to the docker-compose command above to keep the servers running after closing the console. To stop the server and remove the containers, run:
```shell
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm
```
## Usage, from sources
Run the server from the sources (without docker):
```
cd server-nodejs
# install the dependencies
npm install
# run server
node .
```
Then in a web browser, open `http://localhost:8090`

You can specify some environment variables:
```sh
# enable debug
DEBUG=*
# change the http port to listen to
HTTP_PORT=8091
# run server
node .
```
On Windows, to run and debug, run:
```sh
set DEBUG=* & node .
```

## Configure
The server reads its configuration from `docker/damas.json` or `server-nodejs/conf.json` depending on the chosen installation described above. You can edit it according to your needs:

```json
{                                                                                                                     
    "authorMode" : true,
    "db": "mongodb6",
    "mongodb6": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "collection": "node",
        "port": 27017,
        "options": { },
        "create_returns_obj": false
    },
    "extensions": {
    }
}
```
The configuration is divided into sections:
* `authorMode`: if enabled the users are able to edit the nodes created by them
* `db`: which Database Management System to use. Available values: `debug`, `mongodb6`, `mongodb` (legacy)
* `mongodb6`: MongoDB options. Keep the default values to use a database located on the same machine
* `extensions`: modules list to extend the core. See the [Extensions](Extensions.md) page for more details about the available extensions.

Read [JWT extension](Extensions.md#jwt) to enable user authentication according to your needs.

##  Next steps
Now that you have a running server you can read the [Connect Guide](2-Connect.md) to setup a client environment with Python, JavaScript or Shell, and read the [API Reference](3-API-Reference.md).

In case you encounter some difficulties during the installation process you could create an issue describing the problem in this repository and we will try to solve it.
