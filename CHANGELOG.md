# Changelog

## Releases

### 2024-12-21 v2.6
This release brings performance improvement for large databases, easier container deployment with nginx in front of the API. Also, it has a small and optional change in specifications (see below), an improved documentation and 1 bugfix.

#### Added
* JWT extension: new `createToken` operation to generate API JWT keys, to use in API calls.
* The documentation is merged into this repository under the [doc/](doc) directory from the GitHub wiki repository. CHANGELOG.md was added to become less dependant on GitHub for doc.
* added GitHub actions to the repository: build and push the docker image, add clients to release assets, automate tests

#### Changed
* MongoDB driver update. MongoDB server versions 8.x are now supported using the latest MongoDB driver for NodeJS (version 6.8.0). The new driver is specified in `conf.json` by default, pointing to `db/mongodb6.js` and the legacy driver (using Mongo NodeJS driver 2.1.21) is kept under the `db/mongodb.js` for backward compatibility (it can connect to MongoDB servers up to 4.2).
* The `create` operation now returns the newly created object(s) identifier(s) and not entire object(s). ⚠️ **SPECIFICATION CHANGE** ⚠️ Retro compatibility is available using the boolean switch `conf.mongodb6.create_returns_obj` in `conf.json` (default is `false`). Tests are updated accordingly in `server-tests/2-6_spec.js`
* The Docker configuration has entirely moved into the `docker/` directory. The `docker/compose.yaml` file now runs `nginx` and the latest official MongoDB image

#### Fixed
* fixed an error produced by the ulid extension in the `create` operation when the provided `_id` were `null` values.

#### ℹ️  UPGRADE NOTES:
* Newer MongoDB version should properly load the older MongoDB database from the files on disk. If not, use:
```
# make a dump of you existing data using the --forceTableScan option
mongodump --host="<your_current_server>" --forceTableScan
# restore the dump into the new server
mongorestore --host="<your_new_server>" -d node -c node
```
* In the existing `conf.json`, upgrade to the latest MongoDB driver, switching the `db` value from `mongodb` to `mongodb6`.
* After the MongoDB migration, you can decide to use the newer specification of the `create` operation (if you are confident that you have no code on your side that is relying on the previous `create` return values, you can move to the new specifications) or you can keep the previous specification using the `conf.mongodb6.create_returns_obj` boolean switch described above
* if you encounter an issue with the upgrade, please open an issue on the damas-core GitHub repo to get some help

### 2023-04-16 v2.5
This release is a minor release (no change were made to the specifications) which contains improvements to the server, to the Python client, to the CLI and to the documentation.

* support for server redirections
* `.sh` extension removed from the cli command
* errors are written in stderr. closes #254

### 2019-05-24 v2.4
This release adds an extension system to change the server behavior by loading and configuring extensions from its configuration file. A lot of code has been rewritten as extensions (see [server extensions page](https://github.com/remyla/damas-core/wiki/Extensions)). Also, the efforts were made to get a server that can be used as a public web server (able to serve files, manage guest access and node-based permissions).

#### Features
* new extension system to write and add functionalities to extend the server #164  [server extensions](https://github.com/remyla/damas-core/wiki/Extensions)
* new optional permission rule using node's `author` key (to prevent users from reading or updating other users nodes) #189
* new option to allow guest access while authentication is enabled #147
* new extension to define static routes to serve files #172
* command line interface now accepts environment variables #194
* new operation `upsert` in API: update nodes or create nodes if they don't exist yet #155
* support for older NodeJS versions (< ES6) #195
* support for options in regular expressions to allow case insensitive search #86

#### Documentation
* documentation about the [server extensions](https://github.com/remyla/damas-core/wiki/Extensions) #188

### 2016-11-01 v2.3.5
retro tagging for November 2016 stable. Improvements made to the server-nodejs:

* implementation of class-based permissions (#66)
* CRUD operations accept arrays to process multiple nodes per request (See «specifications» page in Wiki)
* event layer and support for connections through web sockets (not used in production yet though)
* bug fixes (key types, server limits)

### 2015-04-07 v2.3.0
The release contains the evolutions from 2014 and is considered as the latest stable. However the Python module is not updated yet. This version is prior to the new implementations we will make during spring 2015.

#### Changes
- CRUDs operations convention implemented strictly:
  - create, read, update, delete, search
  - REST operations and API methods renamed
- The user authentication scheme is updated
  - passwords are stored as sha1 keys on user nodes
- Removed the MySQL 'type' field in the node table - we use a generic 'type' key
  - types are now defined using regular keys (therefore update-able using the update method)
  - removed deprecated setType() function
  - updated message scheme: messages now have a type=message key
  - updated assets: assets now have a type=asset key
- New search method
  - supports this new operators: =, !=, <, >, <=, .=>, LIKE, BETWEEN...AND, REGEXP
  - operators are placed before the value to test { 'keyname': 'operator value' }
  - example of a search pattern { 'type':'=message', 'time':'>1428366657' } to search messages after Apr 7 2015 

### 2015-02-14 v2.2.0
This version is the latest production ready version at that time.

We are already working on the next 2.3.x version (branch 2014) with an updated API, so this should be the latest 2.2.x release appart from bug fixes and minor changes.

The 2014 branch (pre-production) will now be merge to the master branch.

#### Migration of a database from 2.1 to 2.2

_(sorry for the french language, this is temporary, please ask for translation if needed)_
Requête permettant de sélectionner tout les fils et leurs parents et de les mettre dans la table KEY :

```sql
REPLACE INTO `key`(`node_id`, `name`, `value`) SELECT id,"#parent", parent_id FROM node;
```

Requête permettant la vérification de la présence de tout les fils et leurs parents sur la nouvelle table: (La requête renvoie le tableau des occurrences non trouvées dans la nouvelle table et ne renvoie rien si tout y est.)

```sql
SELECT ID, PARENT_ID FROM NODE WHERE (ID, PARENT_ID) NOT IN (SELECT ID, `VALUE` FROM NODE, `KEY` WHERE NAME="#parent" AND ID = NODE_ID);
```

Requête permettant la suppression de la colonne "parent_id" sur la table node:

```sql
ALTER TABLE node DROP COLUMN parent_id;
```

### 2015-02-14 v2.1-stable
This version is ran at Cyber Group Studios in production. This human-readable changelog is started from now, along with the distribution of the source code as Free software.
